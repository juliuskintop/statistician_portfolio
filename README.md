# statistician_portfolio
Portfolio of works done in both R and Python that showcase skills such as machine learning and statistics.

It contains notebooks and reports done in both R and Python that showcase data science, data analysis, and statistics methods to draw insights and make decisions.

## DA Associate Case Study (Python)

The file DA_Associate_case_study.ipynb is a data analysis case study for the DataCamp certification of Data Analyst Associate. It involves loading in a dataset, cleaning the data for proper use, then performing analysis to draw insights.

## DS Associate Case Study (Python)

The file DS_Associate_case_study.ipynb is the data science case study for the DataCamp certification of Data Scientist Associate. It involves loading in a dataset, cleaning the data for proper use, then applying machine learning methods to make predictions and provide recommendations.

## INET 4061 Lab10 (Python)

As part of the class Data Science: Fundamentals (INET 4061) I was required to complete 10 labs that are mini data science projects done in python. This is an example of one of them, and provides a sample business problem, in this case a global climate agency wanted to analyze climate trends, so it is a time series analysis of climate data.

## NFL Capstone Independent Research Project (R)

As part of the University of Minnesota Statistics Capstone class I completed an independent research report which focused on performing machine learning methods including a "hurdle" approach using linear regression and logistic regression and comparing that to a Random Forest model to predict NFL Draft outcomes using NFL Combine metrics such as 40 yard dash, bench press, vertical jump, etc. as predictors.

## Stat 4052 Final Project
